 * `JSON.parse`d — the timeline discards it a few steps later anyway. The

 * returned as stored, so the JSON functions are skipped for the overwhelming
 * majority of events.
 *
 * Two limits of SQLite's string functions are deliberate here, not oversights.
 * `length`/`substr` count Unicode code points where JavaScript counts UTF-16
 * code units, so an output of astral characters comes back at up to twice the
 * cap; the row-level pass recognises the marker and leaves such a value alone
 * rather than cutting it twice. And `length` stops at an embedded NUL, so an
 * output containing one is judged short and passes through untouched — a missed
 * saving, never a wrong value, and the row-level pass still bounds it.
